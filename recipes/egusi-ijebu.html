    <h2>The Ijebu Variant</h2>
    <p> Egusi Ijebu is peculiar for its light and almost runny consistency and it is cooked without vegetables.</p>
    <p>Growing up my mum cooked this variant along with the variant cooked with vegetables. Interesting my husband
        prefers his Egusi without vegetables while I like it vegetables.
    </p>
    <h2>RECIPE</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups ground Egusi (Melon Seeds)</li>
        <li>Assorted Meats (Cowleg, Goat meat, ponmo, offals)</li>
        <li>Assorted Fish (Stock fish, Smoked fish) *ensure you soak stock fish in warm water and salt before cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Grinded crayfish</li>
        <li>2 cups per boiled pepper mix. That is roughly about 4 regular cooking spoons. ( Use peppers according to how
        </li>
        <li>much heat you can handle (Scotch Bonnet/Rodo + Jalapeño/Bawa/Sombo/ long tatashe + Onion)</li>
        <li>Meat Stock (from cooking the meats)</li>
        <li>Bouillon cubes (seasoning cubes)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>3 tbsp Iru (locust beans)</li>
        <li>2 cooking spoons Palm oil</li>
        <li>1 Onion (chopped)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook your meats, season with bouillon cubes, salt, ( i like to cook with smoked catfish head for a richer
            flavour). Cook till tender and well done.</li>
        <li>(Cook time from the point is about 30 mins) Heat up your palm oil till it almost reaches smoking point, pour
            in
            chopped onions and Iru, fry till it caramelizes don’t let it burn.</li>
        <li>Now add your parboiled pepper mix and allow it fry</li>
        <li> Now add the rich stock from your meats and allow to cook.</li>
        <li>Then add the ground melon cook till well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Next add crayfish powder. Taste for seasoning, may not have need to re-season your soup, if your stock is
            rich in flavour. Cook with lid on to allow retain the fluid to reduce faster in the soup.</li>
        <li>Add your assorted meats stock fish and other condiments like those listed in the recipe.</li>
        If you think it is too runny, take the lid off to allow the steam escape and water evaporate. Cook till the
        water has reduced but not pastey.
        <li>Serve with any swallow of your choice. I think Egusi pairs well with white rice.</li>
    </ol>

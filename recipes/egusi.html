    <h2>Egusi Soup: An exotic african dish</h2>
    <p> <b>Egusi soup</b> is native to West Africa (Nigeria), and many of my American and Nigerian friends have enjoyed
        it. It
        is a great soup for those who like to try something different every once in a while. Ground Egusi seeds give
        this soup a unique color and flavor.</p>
    <p>If you can't find Egusi seeds, you can substitute pumpkin seeds. Any combination of crab, shrimp, and smoked fish
        can be used in place of the shrimp. Drained, smoked oysters and chicken can be used in place of the beef.</p>
